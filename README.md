# Team Contract

##Communication

**Team Meetings**

The group will meet every Friday in the afternoon at a time that suits every person. If we can't find a suitable time, we will work out a time in the evening. Thr group will meet once a week, and each meeting should last atleast an hour. We will be making use of Github, VS Code, and Google Docs. Our Google Doc will keep track of team notes.

**Assistance**

We will be using Discord for team communication, and each member should reply with 2 days of receiving a text.

**Respect**

We'll assign every team member critical tasks for the week, so they have sufficient work to do and are involved in team discussions. To ensure that there is mutual respect, we will take conflicting decisions by majority.

##Collaboration

**Work Distribution**

Each week, we will assign a particular task to each member, and we will commuicate on discord or during the weekly meetings to deal with any unforeseen issues.

**Time Commitment**

Each member will do at least 3 hours of work each week, apart from the weekly meetings. There are no prior time commitments that need to be accounted for. It is the teamâ€™s responsibility to make sure that each member's work is delivered by the end of the week. If a team member is not completing their tasks even after repeated requests, they will be required to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken.

**Conflict Resolution**

In case of any conflicts or disagreements between the group, we will vote by majority and take the final decision. We agree that the team will be respectful and make the right decisions.
